## ✨ What Makes This Special?

Imagine if each number on a digital clock was actually composed of **24 tiny analog clocks**, each with their own rotating hands that work together in perfect harmony to display the time. That's exactly what this project brings to life!

🎯 **Each digit (0-9) is a 6×4 grid of 24 coordinated analog clocks**  
⏰ **Real-time updates every second with smooth hand rotations**  
🎨 **Beautiful dark theme with golden accents**  
📱 **Fully responsive design**

## 🎬 How It Works

This isn't just a clock—it's a symphony of synchronized mechanics:

1. **144 Individual Clocks** work together to display time (24 clocks × 6 digits)
2. **Smart Pattern System** maps each digit to specific hand rotations
3. **Real-time Synchronization** updates all clocks simultaneously every second
4. **Visual Magic** transforms abstract numbers into living, breathing clockwork

### The Science Behind the Beauty

```javascript
// Each digit is defined by 24 symbols representing hand positions
'0': [
  '┌', '-', '-', '┐',  // Top border
  '|', '┌', '┐', '|',  // Top sides with inner corners
  '|', '|', '|', '|',  // Middle vertical lines
  '|', '|', '|', '|',  // Middle vertical lines
  '|', '└', '┘', '|',  // Bottom sides with inner corners
  '└', '-', '-', '┘',  // Bottom border
]
```
